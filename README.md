# 327-Project
Final Project Hub for Calorie Tracker App

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
- This project is designed to track and log the amount of calories a user eats on a day by day basis.
Whenever the user opens the app they will be greeted to an overview of progress they have made so
far for 3 categories, proteins, fats, and carbs. At the bottom of the page the user will be prompted
to Add new meals that they want to log, this will then take the user to a new page where they will then
again br prompted to search for the food they want to enter. The user will enter the food and a drop down
menu will appear that contains items to choose from matching the description of what the user has enetered.
Once they add their desired entries, the progress bars will update depending on the category of food. If the user
clicks on the home fragment, it will take them to a page that contains a list of the foods they have
entered, a progress bar for the total amount of calories eaten, the amount of calories they are aiming to reach,
and how many calories they have left to eat.
